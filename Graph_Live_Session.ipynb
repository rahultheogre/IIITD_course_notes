    "A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.\n",

    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering recommenders would look at the content of both movies and determine whether the similarity in content warrants a recommendation. That is, similar items will attract users with similar preferences. Indeed, content-based filtering can really shine in the item cold-start setting. This is when a new item that no users have rated is introduced to the system.\n",

This, indeed, is easily implemented with a few tables connected through appropriate relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of graph becomes clear once we start considering connections other than Movie→HasProperty→Property. In fact we want to express a much richer model where we represent inter-relations between properties - effectively allowing properties to have properties.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a graph structure, we suddenly have many new ways of describing the items we want to recommend. This translates to more complex reasoning about what a given user might appreciate and why when we compare two items. For example, if a user likes “Cloud Atlas” (the movie), they might like “Catch Me If You Can” because Tom Hanks stars in both of them. On the other hand, they could be looking for something different from fiction. If they’re looking for a book to buy, they might like “Cloud Atlas” (the book), and if they also liked “Catch Me If You Can”, maybe they would like the “I Am Malala” book as it is also a biography and won awards similar to the Cloud Atlas book.\n",
